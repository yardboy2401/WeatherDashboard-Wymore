# Weather Dashboard-Wymore

## Your Task

Use a 3rd party weather API to retrieve current and forecast weather data. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).

## Project Notes
When searching for a city, added logic to make it lowercase and also logic so you won't have duplicate city searches in the search history list. Population of local storage to the page upon initial load is working. Ran out of time unfortunately to add a delete search history button. Will try to get that updated and added soon. I don't think it was a requirement for the project, just something I noticed last minute.
